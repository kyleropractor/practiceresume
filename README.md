## Professional Resume

This resume made with javascript was apart of the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree curriculum.

I have added the code to Github so that prospective employers and clients can see and assess the quality of the code.

Take a look at the live version here https://kyleropractor.github.io/professionalresume/.
